CMCS Claim Management System
Student Number: ST10337861 Module: PROG6212 – Programming 3B Lecturer: Amber Brial Submission Date: 21 November

From my lecturers feed back from part 2 it was difficult to find the repo and the code didnt work properly when it was run, i have fixed all these issues as i submited my repo link on arc aswell as published a new repo with the final project into the prog6212 repo making it easier to find.
